# Repository Service Pattern (Practice Demo)

(In progress)

This is a sample project from [Exception Not Found](https://exceptionnotfound.net/the-repository-service-pattern-with-dependency-injection-and-asp-net-core/). This is not my own work and is simply for practice purposes only.

I am attempting to follow along with the demo and the completed repo for their demo can be found here: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/exceptionnotfound/RespositoryServicePatternDemo/tree/master)
